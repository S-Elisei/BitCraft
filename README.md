# BitCraft Processor

Welcome to the BitCraft Processor project! It is intended for enthusiasts, students, and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of fundamental computing principles. The 8-bit processor, which supports the most common instructions, can be built on discrete logic ICs to uncover the magic usually hidden in a single silicon chip.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

-   **Drawings**: Contains PDFs with the electrical circuit diagrams of the BitCraft Processor. These schematics provide a detailed look into the hardware design and architecture.
    
-   **Docs**: This directory houses the programmer's manual, which includes comprehensive documentation on how to program the BitCraft Processor, and an Excel spreadsheet (`xlsx`) with a detailed description of the instruction bytecode format. This information is crucial for anyone looking to write software for or understand the inner workings of the processor.
    
-   **Assembler**: Here, you'll find a Python-based assembler designed specifically for the BitCraft Processor, along with some example programs. This tool allows you to compile assembly language code into bytecode that can be executed by the processor.
    

## PCB Design

As initial circuit was made in simulation, I am currently working on the PCB design for the BitCraft Processor. Once complete, the PCB design files will be shared in this repository, enabling enthusiasts to build their own physical models of the processor.

## Getting Started

To get started with the BitCraft Processor:

1.  **Explore the Docs**: Familiarize yourself with the programmer's manual and the instruction set to understand how to write programs for the processor.
2.  **Check Out the Drawings**: Review the electrical circuit diagrams in the `Drawings` directory to gain insights into the hardware design.
3.  **Use the Assembler**: Write your own programs using the provided assembler. Example programs are available to help you get started.

## Next steps

 - Design more functional IO to support buttons, 7-segment indicators and LED matrix.
 - Improve assembler for more convenient stack/subroutines implementation. 
 - PCB design
 - Build and test with real hardware

## Contributing

I welcome any contributions from the community! Whether it's improving the documentation, adding new example programs, or contributing to the hardware design, your input is valuable.
